# Testing Strategy

**Plugin**: Daily Note Calendar  
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-09  
**Lead Developer Approval**: Production Ready

## Overview

Daily Note Calendar employs a layered testing strategy combining unit tests (Jest), mutation testing (Stryker), and manual QA to ensure production operations readiness.

## Test Coverage Summary

| Layer | Unit Tests | Mutation Score | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Business | 57 test suites | 91.30% | ✅ Production Ready |
| Domain | Models tested | 39.02% | ✅ Accepted (see notes) |
| Infrastructure | 30+ test suites | 96.83% | ✅ Production Ready |
| Presentation | Component tests | Not mutation tested | ⚠️ Manual QA required |

**Overall Mutation Score**: 98.59% (568 mutants tested, 8 verified equivalent mutants)

See [mutation-testing.md](mutation-testing.md) for details on mutation testing approach, equivalent mutants, and policy.

## Testing Boundaries

### What We Test
- **Business logic:** 100% coverage target (managers, parsers, builders, factories)
- **Domain models:** 100% coverage (models, settings, utilities, extensions)
- **Infrastructure repositories:** Full coverage up to adapter contracts
- **Presentation services & handlers:** 100% coverage
- **View models:** Full coverage of concrete implementations

### What We Don't Test
- **Infrastructure adapters** - Direct Obsidian API wrappers; mocking them creates false confidence
- **Plugin lifecycle** - Integration composition; requires manual Obsidian validation
- **React components** - Thin rendering over tested view models; looked at through `npm run preview` (see [Preview Images](#preview-images))
- **Settings UI** - Pure Obsidian UI delegation
- **Command definitions** - Thin wrappers over tested command handlers

### Rationale
The testing boundary aligns with the architectural boundary: we test all code up to the contract seam with Obsidian, then rely on manual validation for integration points.

Obsidian APIs can change independently. Mocking them would create tests that pass while real behavior fails.

### Target Coverage
- Overall: 60-70%
- Business layer: 100%
- Domain layer: 100%
- Infrastructure repositories: 90%+
- Presentation services/handlers: 100%
- View models: 95%+ unit test coverage

**The right 60-70%**: We test business rules and domain logic exhaustively, skip framework integration glue.

### View Model Arithmetic Boundary

**Acceptable in view models:**
- UI layout calculations (grid positioning, responsive breakpoints)
- Presentation formatting (rotating weekday labels, display-order transformations)
- Simple array/string manipulations for rendering
- Coordination between React state and business services

**Belongs in business layer:**
- Date arithmetic that affects note naming, period resolution, or vault queries
- Data transformations that change semantic meaning
- Business rule calculations
- Any logic that would cause incorrect notes to be created/opened if wrong

**Example**: The `buildWeekDays` rotation `(firstDayOfWeek - 1 + 7) % 7` is presentation formatting for calendar headers. If this breaks, no notes are created incorrectly; the UI just displays weekday labels in the wrong order. This is caught by integration tests and manual QA.

### Integration Tests
Adapter tests are preserved in `src/infrastructure/obsidian/__integration-tests__/` for documentation purposes but excluded from the default test suite. They require mocking Obsidian APIs and may drift from real behavior.

To run integration tests manually:
```bash
npm run test -- __integration-tests__
```

## Mutation Testing Philosophy

### Scope

Mutation testing validates business logic correctness and data transformation integrity. The following layers are actively mutation tested:

- ✅ **Business layer** (`src/business/**/*.ts`)
  - Builders, managers, parsers, factories
  - Target: ≥85% mutation score
  - Validates: Note naming, date calculations, period resolution

- ✅ **Domain layer** (`src/domain/**/*.ts`)
  - Models, enums, settings contracts
  - Target: ≥40% (see Domain Settings section)
  - Validates: Model behavior, enum correctness

- ✅ **Infrastructure repositories** (`src/infrastructure/repositories/**/*.ts`)
  - Data transformation, settings merging, vault queries
  - Target: ≥70% mutation score
  - Validates: Repository correctness, null safety, edge cases

- ✅ **Infrastructure parsers** (`src/infrastructure/parsers/**/*.ts`)
  - Date parsing, format conversion
  - Target: ≥70% mutation score
  - Validates: Parsing correctness, format compatibility

### Excluded from Mutation Testing

- ❌ **Presentation layer** (`src/presentation/**/*.ts`)
  - Command handlers are thin wrappers delegating to business layer
  - View models contain coordination logic covered by integration tests
  - React components rely on manual QA and component tests
  - **View model arithmetic**: Simple presentation formatting (e.g., weekday rotation, UI layout calculations) is acceptable in view models and covered by integration tests; complex date calculations belong in business layer
  - **Risk mitigation**: Integration tests, E2E user flows, manual QA

- ❌ **Infrastructure adapters** (`src/infrastructure/adapters/**/*.ts`, `src/infrastructure/obsidian/**/*.ts`)
  - Direct Obsidian API integration with high mocking cost
  - **Risk mitigation**: Repository tests, runtime validation

- ❌ **Infrastructure factories** (`src/infrastructure/factories/**/*.ts`)
  - Mostly composition with low mutation value
  - **Risk mitigation**: Integration tests

## Domain Settings Treatment

### Accepted Low Mutation Scores

Domain settings files contain pure constant declarations:

- `period-note.settings.ts`: **0.00%** (15 survived mutants)
- `display-notes.settings.ts`: **25.00%** (3 survived mutants)
- `general.settings.ts`: **25.00%** (3 survived mutants)

**Rationale**: These files export constant objects like:
```typescript
export const DEFAULT_DAILY_NOTE_SETTINGS: PeriodNoteSettings = {
    nameTemplate: 'yyyy-MM-dd',
    folder: 'Daily notes',
    templateFile: 'Templates/Daily note',
};
```

Mutations change literal values (`'yyyy-MM-dd'` → `''`), but tests don't (and shouldn't) assert exact string values of defaults. Tests validate *behavior*: "when settings repository returns defaults, the correct defaults are applied."

**Risk Assessment**: Low. If someone accidentally changes a default value, manual QA and integration tests will catch it. Creating tests that assert string literals would be brittle and provide minimal value.

**Status**: **Accepted**. Domain settings weakness is documented and understood by the team.

## Mutation Testing Configuration

**File**: `stryker.config.mjs`

```javascript
mutate: [
  'src/business/**/*.ts',
  'src/domain/**/*.ts',
  'src/infrastructure/repositories/**/*.ts',
  'src/infrastructure/parsers/**/*.ts',
  '!src/**/*.spec.ts',
]
```

**Thresholds**:
- High: 85%
- Low: 60%
- Break: `null` (to be enabled at `break: 70` after CI integration)

**Performance**: ~2-3 minutes runtime with concurrency settings optimized for dev container

## Production Approval Criteria

✅ **All criteria met as of 2026-04-08**

1. ✅ Business layer mutation score ≥ 85% — **Actual: 91.30%**
2. ✅ Infrastructure repositories mutation score ≥ 70% — **Actual: 96.67%**
3. ✅ Infrastructure parsers mutation score ≥ 70% — **Actual: 100.00%**
4. ✅ Overall mutation score ≥ 75% — **Actual: 83.88%**
5. ✅ All files in mutation scope ≥ 70% — **100% compliance**
6. ✅ Settings repositories tested for default merging — **Verified**

## Mutation Test Remediation (2026-04-09)

Following a comprehensive mutation testing review, the team implemented targeted improvements across business and presentation layers. This section documents the triage decisions and remediation work.

### Triage Strategy

Adopted a **layered triage approach** where each layer has different testing economics:
- **Domain settings**: Accept survived mutants (pure data declarations, covered by integration tests)
- **Business logic**: Add focused edge-case tests (high value, prevents user-facing bugs)
- **Command handlers**: Remove unnecessary optional chaining (clarify initialization contracts)
- **View models**: Accept arithmetic mutants (presentation formatting, covered by integration/manual QA)
- **Infrastructure**: Accept current scores above 70% threshold

### Work Completed

**Phase 1: Command Handler Refactoring** (10 files, 10-15 mutants addressed)
- Removed optional chaining (`?.call(this)`) from all command handlers
- Changed callbacks from optional to required in `CalendarViewModel` interface
- **Rationale**: Optional chaining survived mutation because callbacks are always defined at runtime
- **Outcome**: Cleaner code, explicit initialization contract, no runtime impact
- **Files**: All handlers in `src/presentation/command-handlers/`

**Phase 2: Variable Factory Edge Cases** (14 new tests, 7-8 mutants killed)
- Added tests for multi-digit calculus values (`+10d`, `+100y`, `-99m`)
- Added tests for invalid calculus format (missing components, invalid operators)
- Added tests for non-numeric values and zero edge cases
- **Critical bug found**: Main regex only captured single-digit values
  - **Before**: `/{{([a-z]+)([+-][0-9].)...}}/` (captures `+2d` but fails on `+10d`)
  - **After**: `/{{([a-z]+)([+-][0-9]+[a-z])...}}/` (correctly captures multi-digit)
  - **Impact**: Multi-digit calculus values were completely broken in production
- **Outcome**: 11 → 25 tests, critical production bug fixed
- **File**: [default.variable-factory.spec.ts](src/business/factories/default.variable-factory.spec.ts)

**Phase 3: Note Manager Sorting Tests** (3 new tests, 4-5 mutants killed)
- Added tests for descending sort with `createdOnProperty`
- Added tests for ascending sort with `createdOnProperty`
- Added tests for arithmetic correctness (newest-first vs oldest-first)
- **Outcome**: 20 → 23 tests, conditional branches fully exercised
- **File**: [repository.note-manager.spec.ts](src/business/managers/repository.note-manager.spec.ts)

### Validation Results

**Before remediation:**
- Total tests: 501
- Mutation survivors: 57 (across all layers)
- Key gaps: Optional chaining, regex validation, sorting branches

**After remediation:**
- Total tests: 518 (+17 tests)
- Command handlers: Cleaner contracts, no false safety
- Business logic: 1 critical bug fixed, edge cases covered
- All tests pass: ✅
- TypeScript compiles cleanly: ✅

### Design Smells Addressed

1. **Optional chaining as silent failure protection**
   - **Smell**: Command handlers used `?.call()` but callbacks were never undefined
   - **Fix**: Made contract explicit (callbacks required), removed optional chaining
   
2. **Edge-case gaps in regex validation**
   - **Smell**: Variable factory regex accepted too much input without validation
   - **Fix**: Added explicit validation tests, discovered and fixed single-digit limitation

3. **Untested conditional branches in data transformation**
   - **Smell**: Sorting logic had multiple branches but tests didn't exercise all combinations
   - **Fix**: Added focused tests for each conditional combination

### Mutation Testing Boundaries Clarified

**Always mutation test:**
- ✅ Business logic determining which note to create/open
- ✅ Data parsing and validation (regex, date formats, template variables)
- ✅ Conditional logic with semantic impact (filtering, sorting, branching)
- ✅ Repository transformations (settings merging, query logic)

**Never mutation test:**
- ❌ Pure constant declarations (domain settings defaults)
- ❌ Obsidian API adapters (high mocking cost, false confidence)
- ❌ React components (thin rendering over tested view models)
- ❌ Plugin lifecycle composition (`onload`, dependency wiring)

**Context-dependent:**
- ⚠️ **View model arithmetic**: Acceptable if pure presentation formatting; not acceptable if affects business rules
- ⚠️ **Infrastructure string operations**: Acceptable if above 70% threshold; not acceptable if core logic untested
- ⚠️ **Optional chaining**: Acceptable if genuinely defensive; not acceptable if hiding initialization problems

**Economic test**: Would a bug here cause the wrong note to be created, opened, or displayed? If yes, require mutation coverage. If no, rely on integration/manual QA.

## Known Acceptable Gaps

### adapter.file-repository.ts (92.00%)

**Survived mutants**: 2 mutants in path splitting logic
- `slice(0, -1)` → `slice(0, +1)` (unary operator)
- `join('/')` → `join("")` (string literal)

**Status**: Above 70% threshold, acceptable for production  
**Risk**: Low (path handling is well-tested, survivors are edge cases)  
**Future**: Consider adding tests for root paths and nested path edge cases

### Domain Settings (8.70%)

**Status**: Accepted per architectural guidance (see Domain Settings Treatment section)  
**Risk**: Low (defaults verified through integration testing)

## Test Quality Standards

### Unit Test Requirements

Every unit test must:
- Have a clear behavioral purpose
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- Use descriptive names explaining scenario and expected outcome
- Verify actual behavior, not just that mocks were called
- Be non-duplicative with existing coverage

### Test Review Checklist

Before accepting new or modified tests:
- Does the test prove something new?
- Does it protect a real behavior or close a regression gap?
- Is it focused with a single behavioral reason to fail?
- Does it avoid mirroring implementation details?
- Are there any duplicate tests covering the same scenario?

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test                      # Run all tests
npm run test -- <pattern>         # Run specific test file
npm run test -- --coverage        # Generate coverage report
```

### Mutation Testing
```bash
npm run mutation                  # Run mutation tests (~3 minutes)
```

**Note**: Mutation testing requires approximately 3 minutes to complete. Results available at `reports/mutation/mutation.html`.

### Build Validation
```bash
npm run build                     # TypeScript compilation + bundle
```

### Preview Images
```bash
npm run preview                   # Draw the view into preview/*.png
```

No test layer paints, so nothing above tells you whether the screen still
looks right. `preview.mts` renders the real components over invented data —
the note tab, the log and plan tabs, an empty side, a failed read and a day
with no notes, in both themes — and writes them as images. The clock is
frozen at a constant, so two runs produce byte-identical files: a diff
against the previous run is a regression check for the view, which is how
the same tool caught a silent change in `weekly-log-viewer`.

Nothing in it may point at real data. The Apple Calendar repository is
replaced by a stub answering from arrays in the script, and no vault is
opened. `preview/` is ignored by git.

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-Commit Validation
- All unit tests must pass
- TypeScript compilation must succeed
- No new linting errors

### Pre-Release Validation
- All unit tests must pass
- Mutation score must remain ≥ 75%
- Manual QA of key user workflows
- Build artifact validated

### Future: CI Enforcement

After establishing stable baseline:
1. Enable `break: 70` in `stryker.config.mjs`
2. Add mutation testing to GitHub Actions CI
3. Fail builds if mutation score drops below 70%

## Risk Mitigation Beyond Mutation Testing

Mutation testing validates deterministic logic correctness but does not replace:

### Integration Testing
- Actual Obsidian vault operations
- Plugin lifecycle (load, settings, commands)
- File system interactions
- **Status**: Requires manual execution in live Obsidian environment

### Manual QA
- UI flows (calendar navigation, note creation)
- Settings UI functionality
- Error handling edge cases
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Status**: Execute before each release

### Beta User Feedback
- Real-world usage patterns
- Performance at scale (large vaults)
- Platform-specific issues
- **Status**: Gather before major version releases

## Historical Baseline

### April 2026 — Production Approval
- Overall mutation score: 83.88%
- Business layer: 91.30%
- Infrastructure layer: 96.83%
- 424 unit tests passing
- Zero TypeScript errors
- **Status**: Approved for production operations

### Key Improvements Made
1. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in test files (vi.mocked() patterns)
2. Expanded mutation scope to infrastructure repositories and parsers
3. Achieved 100% mutation score for adapter.note-repository.ts
4. Documented and accepted domain settings low scores
5. Established concurrency settings for dev container stability

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. Add unit tests for new business logic
2. Ensure new infrastructure code reaches ≥70% mutation score
3. Update this document if testing philosophy changes
4. Run full test suite before committing

### When Tests Fail
1. Understand the failure before fixing
2. Question whether the test or the code is wrong
3. If fixing a test, ensure it still validates meaningful behavior
4. If changing production code, verify mutation score doesn't decrease

### When Mutation Score Drops
1. Identify which file(s) caused the drop
2. Review survived mutants in HTML report
3. Add focused tests targeting specific mutants
4. Do not add tests just to kill mutants—add tests that validate behavior
