## This is a modified fork

**Periodic Log Calendar** (plugin id `periodic-log-calendar`) is a fork of
[**Daily note calendar**](https://github.com/bartkessels/daily-note-calendar) by
**Bart Kessels**, who wrote everything this plugin does with periodic notes. It is
published under the GPL-3.0, the same licence as the original, and this file records
that it has been modified and what was changed.

Forked from upstream **2.8.0**. Modified by tak0407, from **September 2026**:

| | Change |
|---|---|
| Plugin identity | `id` is `periodic-log-calendar` and `isDesktopOnly` is `true`, so this fork installs beside the original instead of replacing it, and stays off mobile — it shells out to `sqlite3`, which mobile has no way to run. |
| Log and plan timeline | The area below the calendar has two tabs. *Notes* is the original view, unchanged and still the default. *Log & plan* puts the selected day's Apple Calendar records and plans on one time axis. |
| Locale week days | The calendar header takes its day names from the system locale instead of hardcoded English abbreviations. |
| Fixed day numbers | The day number in each cell is rendered with the `en` locale, so it stays in western digits. |
| Year before month | The calendar header shows the year before the month, the order CJK locales write dates in. |
| Week period bug fix | A week's month, quarter and year now follow the requested date rather than the day the week starts on. See [ADR-002](docs/adrs/ADR-002-derive-week-period-from-the-requested-date.md). |

The *Log & plan* tab reads Apple Calendar through code ported from
[**weekly-log-viewer**](https://github.com/tak0407/weekly-log-viewer) `1.4.0`, which is
MIT licensed; the ported files carry that notice. It reads the calendar database
**read-only** and never writes to it.

Upstream is tracked on the `upstream` remote, and this fork keeps its changes in new
files wherever it can so that merges stay cheap.

The Daily note calendar plugin started as a hobby project because another calendar plugin to open daily notes couldn't
handle my own date format for daily notes which is (`yyyyMMdd - eeee` e.g. 20241231 - Saturday). Therefore, I decided to
write my own plugin which allows you to customize the format of your daily and even weekly notes.

# 1. Features

![Daily note calendar plugin light mode](./docs/images/daily-note-calendar-light-mode.png)

## 1.1 Periodic notes

Quickly navigate your vault using a calendar view, this plugin allows you to create and navigate to your periodic notes
such as

- Daily notes
    - By clicking on a specific date
- Weekly notes
    - By clicking on the week number
- Monthly notes
    - By clicking on the month name
- Quarterly notes
    - By clicking on the quarter name in the upper-left corner
- Yearly notes
    - By clicking on the year number

For each note, you can specify the template of the name `yyyy-MM-dd - eeee` and the folder where the newly created
periodic note should be stored.
The path is also customizable using the date formatting rules of [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/docs/format).

Below each date, you can choose to display an indicator whether or note that date already has a note.

## 1.2 Variables

All the notes that you create must be based on a template, this allows you to create your periodic note based on the
same template every time.
Inside your template-file you can use the following variables:

| Variable               | Description                                                                                  | Template                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{date:<template>}}`  | The date of the note. This date is based on the date that you've clicked on in the calendar. | You can use the same date templating rules of [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/format) that you use in the name or the folder. Thus `{{date:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee}}` would turn into _2024-12-31 - Monday_.                |
| `{{today:<template>}}` | The date of today. This date is based on the date and time of creation of the note.          | You can use the same date templating rules of [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/format) that you use in the name or the folder. Thus `{{today:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee, HH:mm}}` would turn into _2024-12-31 - Monday, 12:59_. |
| `{{title}}`            | -                                                                                            | This will take the title of the note you had opened before clicking a date in the calendar.                                                                                                                                |

### 1.2.1 Calculating dates

For the `{{date:<template>}}` and `{{today:<template>}}` variables, you can add or subtract _days_, _weeks_, _months_
and _years_.

You can subtract or add a period using the `+` or `-` sign followed by the period and the amount of that period
you want to add or subtract.

| Period | Variable       | Template example                |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Day    | `+1d` or `-1d` | `{{date+1d:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee}}` |
| Week   | `+1w` or `-1w` | `{{date+1w:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee}}` |
| Month  | `+1m` or `-1m` | `{{date+1m:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee}}` |
| Year   | `+1y` or `-1y` | `{{date+1y:yyyy-MM-dd - eeee}}` |

Where the number is the amount of the period you want to add or subtract.

The complete template would look like `{{date+1y:<template>}}` or `{{today+1y:<template>}}`. to add one year to the
date. You can change the amount or the period in the above example to any period from the above table.

## 1.3 Notes created on a specific day

For each day you select, you can enable the feature to display all the notes created on that specific day below the
calendar. This allows you to easily navigate your vault using the calendar view and quickly find the notes you've created on any
day.

In the settings, you can specify how you want the plugin to find the notes created on a date. Either use the default
created date of the actual file or use a specific property in the front matter of the note.

The _created on_ time displayed below each note can be customized using the date formatting rules of [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/docs/format).

You can always navigate to created notes by pressing the `shift` key and clicking on the date. This will only list the notes created on that date and not open or create the daily note.

## 1.4 Commands

To navigate your vault even faster, the Daily Notes Calendar plugin offers a couple of commands to navigate your periodic notes.

![Daily notes calendar plugin commands](./docs/images/daily-note-calendar-commands.png)

### 1.4.1 Open periodic notes

You can open your weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly note by using the one of the following commands

#### Open weekly note

`Daily notes calendar: Open weekly note`
> If today is 2024-12-31, the command will open the note `2024-W52` in the folder specified in the settings.

#### Open monthly note
`Daily notes calendar: Open monthly note`
> If today is 2024-12-31, the command will open the note `2024-12` in the folder specified in the settings.

#### Open quarterly note
`Daily notes calendar: Open quarterly note`
> If today is 2024-12-31, the command will open the note `2024-Q4` in the folder specified in the settings.

#### Open yearly note
`Daily notes calendar: Open yearly note`
> If today is 2024-12-31, the command will open the note `2024` in the folder specified in the settings.

### 1.4.2 Navigate to the next or previous week

You can navigate the calendar to the next or previous week by using the following commands

`Daily notes calendar: Navigate to the next week`
> This will navigate to the next week relative to the current weeks in the calendar.

`Daily notes calendar: Navigate to the previous week`
> This will navigate to the previous week relative to the current weeks in the calendar.

### 1.4.3 Navigate to the next or previous month

You can navigate the calendar to the next or previous month by using the following commands

`Daily notes calendar: Navigate to the next month`
> This will navigate to the next month relative to the current month in the calendar.

`Daily notes calendar: Navigate to the previous month`
> This will navigate to the previous month relative to the current month in the calendar.

### 1.4.4 Display the current note in calendar

You can navigate to the current note's date in the calendar using the following command

`Daily notes calendar: Display the current note in calendar`
> This will navigate the calendar to the date of the currently opened note.
> This will either take the creation date of the note, or the created date property if you've enabled that setting.

## 1.5 Displaying notes created on a specific day

When you've enabled the feature to display notes created on a specific day, you can also choose to display the current opened note in the calendar. This can be done by using the command `Daily notes calendar: Display the current note in calendar`.
This will highlight the date of the current note in the calendar, and below the calendar all notes that are created on the same date as the currently opened note.

The command will either use the date that the note was created on, or the property specified in the plugin settings.

# 2. External dependencies

The Daily note calendar plugin
uses [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) as a package manager,
so most dependencies required by the plugin can be installed using the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To locally test your plugin, you need to have Obsidian (which is pretty self-explanatory why). For more information
about the process of developing an Obsidian plugin, I'm happy to refer you to the
[Obsidian documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin).

# 3. Build and test

To build and test the daily-note-calendar plugin, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run test
```

Only the business logic is tested that doesn't depend on anything from Obsidian.

# 4. Contribute

Is there a feature you'd like to see, or a bug you've encountered? Please let us know, and help us make the _Daily note
calendar_ great for everyone! Or, if you're a developer, try to fix it yourself! If you'd like to contribute back to the
project, but you're not quite sure yet what you can add, take a look at the [roadmap](#11-roadmap).

All contributions are welcome, so feel free to join the open source community and support _Daily note calendar_ through
your expertise!

To make sure everyone can contribute to _Daily note calendar_ we value the quality and understandability of our code and
repository.
So when you're building a feature, or patching a bug, and you've made a decision, please document that decision in the [
`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) document. This will help future contributors to understand your rationale. If you've
updated some logic in the code, please check the decision records and update the related ones. If you've done all this,
update the test-suite and validate that your newly created code does exactly what you'd documented.

## 4.1 Branching strategy

So now that your idea is implemented, documented and tested, it's time to merge it into the project! To help you out a
bit on how to set up a branch, we've got you covered in this chapter!

The _Daily notes calendar_ project does not use a development branch but instead uses short-lived feature branches which
are directly merged into the `main`-branch. We've chosen this strategy 'cause we believe in _release often, release
fast_. There's no need for your feature to gather dust in a stale `development` branch while waiting on some arbitrary
date to be released. But, we do however, have some guidelines:

- If you're contributing a __feature__ use the `feature/<your-feature-name>` naming convention
- If you're contributing a __bug fix__ use the `bugfix/<the-name-of-the-bug>` naming convention.
- If you're contributing to __documentation__ use the `documentation/<name-of-change>` naming convention.
- If you're contributing a __hot fix__ use the `hotfix/<hotfix-type>-<name>` naming convention
    - These can be useful for updating dependency versions

# 5. Create a new release

To create a new release of the plugin, edit the `package.json` file and update the `version` property. Then run
`npm run version` to update the version in the `manifest.json` and `versions.json` file.
Once the release is completed, merge the branch back into the `main` branch.

For versioning _Daily note calendar_ uses semantic versioning.
Which, given the documentation on [semver.org](https://semver.org), means that the version number consists of
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

When creating a release of _Daily note plugin_, check what kind of changes have been applied since the previous version
and categorize these in one of the following segments:

1. Incompatible API change, or a user interface change
2. New functionality which doesn't break existing functionality
3. Bug fix

These can be mapped on the semantic versioning scheme in the following ways:

* Update the __MAJOR__ version when you've made a __breaking change__ either in the interfaces or in the UI.
* Update the __MINOR__ version when a __new feature__ is introduced
* Update the __PATCH__ version when a __bug is resolved__

When you've updated the version in `package.json` create a new tag in Git using the
following structure: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
For version 5 with a bugfix this would be `5.0.1`.

This can be created using the following Git-command:

```bash
$ git tag -a 5.0.1
$ git push -u origin 5.0.1
```

This will create the tag locally and then push it to Github which in turn will kick off the required
pipelines to create the new release and add the build artifacts.
